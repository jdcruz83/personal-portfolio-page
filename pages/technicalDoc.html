            <article>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the
                    web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                    consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of
                    content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a
                    hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
                    following line of text:
                <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    a paragraph <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>My cat is very grumpy<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or
                    lowercase. For example, a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag could be written as
                    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</code>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags
                    in lowercase for consistency and readability.

            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <article>
                <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png"
                    alt="Image of an HTML element explained">
                <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for
                        paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the
                        element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph
                        text.</li>
                    <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph
                        text.</li>
                    <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                        slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing
                        tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
                <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
                <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our
                    cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which
                    means that the
                    word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>My cat is <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>very<code>&lt;/strong&gt;</code> grumpy.
                </p>
                <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first,
                    then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before
                    closing the p.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>My cat is <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>very
                    grumpy.<code>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code> <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                <p>The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind
                    of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can
                    result in unexpected results.</p>
                <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline
                    elements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                        following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also
                        appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For
                        example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or
                        footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be
                        nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                        document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not
                        cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an
                        &lt;a&gt; element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> create
                        emphasis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
                <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements
                    consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For
                    example, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
                    alt="Attribute example">
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this
                    example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style
                    information.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the
                        attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another example of an element is <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. This stands for anchor. An anchor can make
                    the text it
                    encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>href:</b> This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example:
                        <code>href="https://www.mozilla.org/"</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>title:</b> The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a
                        description of the page that is being linked to. For example,
                        <code>title="The Mozilla homepage"</code>. This
                        appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>target:</b> The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For
                        example, <code>target="_blank"</code> will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display
                        the linked
                        content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are
                    called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same
                    as the attribute name. For example, consider the <u>disabled</u> attribute, which you can assign to
                    form input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make
                    entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;</code></p>

            <article>
                <p>Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements
                    combine to form an entire HTML page.</p>
                <p>We have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were
                        meant to act
                        as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More
                        recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to
                        work right. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of characters that counts
                        as a valid
                        doctype. That is all you need to know! </li>
                    <p>More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else
                        to work right. <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> is the shortest string of characters that
                        counts as a valid
                        doctype. That is all you need to know!</p>
                    <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element
                        wraps all the content on the
                        page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts
                        as a container for
                        everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to
                        viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS
                        to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the
                        next article of the series.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element. This element
                        represents metadata that
                        cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <code>&lt;base&gt;</code>,
                        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>,
                        <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. The
                        charset attributes sets the character set
                        for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human
                        written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might
                        contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the
                        title of the page, which
                        is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used
                        to describe the page when it is bookmarked.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all
                        the content that displays
                        on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Whitespace in HTML</h3>
                <p>No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more
                    space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a
                    single space when rendering the code. So why use so much whitespace? The answer is readability.</p>
                <p>It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted. In our
                    HTML we've got each nested element indented by two spaces more than the one it is sitting inside. It
                    is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for
                    example), but you should consider formatting it.</p>
            </article>

            <header>Entity references</header>
            <article>
                <p>In HTML, the characters <code>&lt;</code> ,<code>&gt;</code> , <code>"</code> , <code>'</code> and
                    <code>&</code> are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax
                    itself. So how do you include one of these special characters in your text? For example, if you
                    want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it interpreted as code.
                </p>
                <p>You do this with character references. These are special codes that represent characters, to be used
                    in these exact circumstances. Each character reference starts with an ampersand (<code>&</code>),
                    and ends with a
                    semicolon (<code>;</code>).</p>

                <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making
                    comments
                    invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to
                    explain
                    your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long
                    enough
                    that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are
                    making
                    changes and updates.</p>
                <p>To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <code>&lt;!-- and --&gt;</code>.</p>
